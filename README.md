## Minecraft

You will a valid need Minecraft Java Edition license. Java Edition is the name they eventually gave the original edition of Minecraft for PCs to differentiate it from all the other editions they made later.

If you don't own it already, you can buy it here:

<https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-java-edition>

If you already have a license, or just bought one, you can download the launcher here:

<https://launcher.mojang.com/download/MinecraftInstaller.msi>

If the above URL stops working, check this page:

<https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download>

## Forge

The forge installer requires Java to run it, an installer for the latest long-term supported version can be downloaded from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/), once on the page select your OS and file, e.g. Windows and the x64 installer:

Open the downloaded `.jar` file to run it.

Choose the *Install client* option:

The installer will then do a bunch of work and when done show a dialogue titled "Complete" with an "OK" button.
